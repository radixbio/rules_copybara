* Usage
** Getting started
Follow the instructions in the [[*Installation][Installation]] section
** Examples
*** External repository pulled in to source tree
**** a simple example
in =scalaz3.sky=
#+begin_src python
core.workflow(
    name = "z3",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = "https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git",
        ref = "z3-4.11.2",
    ),
    origin_files = glob(["**"]),
    destination = folder.destination(),
    destination_files = glob(["**"]),
    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("z3 copybara update <copybara@radix.bio>"),
    transformations = [
        patch.apply(patches = ["examples/z3.patch"], strip = 0),
    ],
)

#+end_src

and the rule invocation in a =BUILD= file
#+begin_src python
copybara(
    name = "z3-copybara-import", # name of the rule
    additional_files = ["//examples:z3.patch"], # additional files you may need
    destination_dir = "3rdparty/copybara/z3", # to land in the source tree of the repo with this BUILD file
    workflow_defs = "//examples:z3.sky", # the workflow definition
    workflows = ["z3"], # select which workflows to run
)
#+end_src
**** a (slightly) more complex example
in =scalaz3.sky=
#+begin_src python
core.workflow(
    name = "scalaz3",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = "https://github.com/epfl-lara/ScalaZ3.git",

    transformations = [
        patch.apply(patches = ["examples/scalaz3.patch"], strip = 0),
        core.replace(
            before = """import org.scalatest.{FunSuite, Matchers}""",
            after = """import org.scalatest.funsuite.AnyFunSuite\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers""",

            after = "extends AnyFunSuite",
            paths = glob(["src/test/**/*.scala"]),
        ),
    ],
)

#+end_src

and the corresponding build target
#+begin_src python
copybara(
    name = "scalaz3-copybara-import",
    additional_files = ["//copybara/workflow_files:scalaz3.patch"],
    destination_dir = "3rdparty/copybara/scalaz3",

*** Push out a folder to an external repository
*** Synchronize pull requests from an external GitHub repository
*** Push pull requests to an external GitHub repository
** Things to keep in mind
- Copybara does not have CI on its repo, so not all commit hashes work.
- Copybara includes bazel's source tree itself in its dependencies, and not all versions of bazel can build bazel. At the time of writing, latest master works only on bazel =6.0.0=, whereas the version I use (since i'm on bazel =5.3.1=) works with commit =6cd64320=
